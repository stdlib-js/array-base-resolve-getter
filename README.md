    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/array-base-resolve-getter
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

## Usage

```javascript
var resolveGetter = require( '@stdlib/array-base-resolve-getter' );
```

#### resolveGetter( x )

Returns an accessor function for retrieving an element from an array-like object.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];

var get = resolveGetter( x );
var v = get( x, 2 );
// returns 3
```

The returned accessor function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arr**: input array.
-   **idx**: element index.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If provided an array-like object having an unsupported [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes], the function returns a default accessor function for accessing elements from any array-like object; otherwise, the function returns an accessor function which should **only** be provided an array instance having the same data type (e.g., if provided a `Float64Array`, the returned accessor function should only be provided instances of `Float64Array`).
-   Accessor functions do **not** verify that provided input arrays are array instances having a specific data type, as doing so would introduce performance overhead. If array instances corresponding to other data types are provided to an accessor function, JavaScript runtimes will consider the function polymorphic, potentially triggering de-optimization. In order to ensure maximum performance, **always** ensure that an accessor function is monomorphic.
-   Accessor functions do **not** perform bounds checking.
-   Accessor functions do **not** verify that provided input arrays implement the get/set protocol.
-   An _indexed_ array-like object is a data structure in which one retrieves elements via integer indices using bracket `[]` notation (e.g., `Float64Array`, `Int32Array`, `Array`, etc). This is in contrast to an _accessor_ array-like object in which one retrieves elements using `get` and `set` methods (e.g., `Complex64Array` and `Complex128Array`).

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var filled = require( '@stdlib/array-filled' );
var resolveGetter = require( '@stdlib/array-base-resolve-getter' );

var arr = filled( 1.0, 10, 'float64' );
var v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 1.0

arr = filled( 2.0, 10, 'float32' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 2.0

arr = filled( 3, 10, 'int32' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 3

arr = filled( 4, 10, 'int16' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 4

arr = filled( 5, 10, 'int8' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 5

arr = filled( 6, 10, 'uint32' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 6

arr = filled( 7, 10, 'uint16' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 7

arr = filled( 8, 10, 'uint8' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 8

arr = filled( 9, 10, 'uint8c' );
v = resolveGetter( arr )( arr, 2 );
// returns 9
